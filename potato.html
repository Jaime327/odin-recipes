    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>

    <p>
        Latkes (a.k.a. potato pancakes) are a crowd-pleasing addition to any table —<br> 
        and this family recipe will impress even the pickiest eaters. The secret<br> 
        ingredient? Saltine crackers! The pantry staple replaces all-purpose flour, binds<br> 
        the latkes together, and contributes to the irresistible texture. Though they're<br> 
        traditionally served during Hanukkah, you'll want to enjoy these wonderfully<br> 
        crispy and savory latkes all year long.

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine potato, onion, crushed crackers, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a<br> 
            large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of potato mixture, first pressing mixture against side of the bowl<br> 
            to remove excess liquid, into hot oil; slightly flatten latkes with the back of a<br> 
            spoon to make an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook in batches until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on<br> 
            a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
